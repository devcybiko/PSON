Mickie Most used session musicians on many records he produced; this was industry practice at the time. Even such respected groups as the Yardbirds were required by Most to use session musicians except Jimmy Page on their Most-produced recordings.,

    body: The success of \Dream a Little Dream of Me\ confirmed Elliot's desire to embark on a solo career, and by the end of 1968 it appeared that the group had split. John Phillips recalled, \Times had changed. The Beatles showed the way. Music itself was heading toward a technological and compositional complexity that would leave many of us behind. It was tough to keep up.\ The group made its demise official in early 1969, as John Phillips recalled, saying \Dunhill released us from our contracts and we were history, though we still owed the label another album.\,

BMI's website now credits all original Kimmel-Edwards songs to Kimmel alone, resulting in \Back Home\ being Edwards's lone songwriting credit with the Stone Poneys.,
