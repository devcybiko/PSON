    body: Spanky and Our Gang was an American 1960s sunshine pop band led by Elaine Spanky McFarlane. \
The band derives its name from Hal Roach's Our Gang comedies of the 1930s known to modern audiences as The Little Rascals, \
because of the similarity of her surname with that of George McFarland Spanky. \
The group was known for its vocal harmonies.
